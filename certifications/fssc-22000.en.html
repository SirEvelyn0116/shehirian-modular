                <h2>What is FSSC 22000?</h2>
                <p>FSSC 22000 (Food Safety System Certification) is a robust, ISO-based food safety management system certification scheme. It provides a framework for effectively managing food safety responsibilities and is fully recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI).</p>
                <p>Built on the foundation of ISO 22000, FSSC 22000 integrates the ISO 9001 quality management approach with HACCP principles and sector-specific prerequisite programs. This comprehensive standard is used by over 20,000 certified organizations across the entire food supply chain, from farming to retail.</p>
