# Dummy File

This is a placeholder file to ensure the directory structure is maintained in version control.

## Purpose

Git does not track empty directories. This file exists to:
- Ensure the `dist` directory is created
- Allow the directory to be committed and pushed to the repository

## Note

This file can be safely deleted once the directory contains actual build outputs or generated files.

```javascript
// Placeholder code example
console.log('Directory placeholder');
```
